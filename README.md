# Rudravyas233-16-Bit-CPU-Design-using-Logisim
This project designs a 16-bit CPU using Logisim, featuring registers, an ALU, and a control unit. It executes AND, ADD, LDA, and STA instructions via a fetch-decode-execute cycle. The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations, while the control unit manages execution, providing a foundation for CPU architecture enhancements.
